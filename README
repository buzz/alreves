-- ALREVES
 
Alreves is an web application framework based on an unusual design
concept. It's still in early development.
 
And the idea behind it?
 
The short answer:
Alreves moves the application view entirely to the client's computer.
 
A bit longer answer:
While usual web application frameworks generate the HTML-code on the
server-side Alreves goes the other way around and processes templates
directly in the user's web browser.

-- FIRST STEPS

To create the famous 'Hello World' example using Alreves on Rails:

1. Create Rails project:

 $ rails my_project

2. Engines is an extension to the Rails own plugin system that Alreves depends
on. So we install it first:

 $ cd my_project 
 $ script/plugin discover
 $ script/plugin install engines

Put this line in 'environment.rb' just below the
require for Railsâ€™ own boot.rb file:

require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

3. Install jRails plugin as Alreves uses jQuery and not Prototype.
 $ script/plugin install http://ennerchi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/jrails

4. Alreves comes as Rails plugin:

 $ script/plugin install git://github.com/buzz/alreves.git --force

The '--force' is needed to make the script overwrite 'public/index.html' as
Alreves needs this file to work. If you're adding Alreves to an existing
project, make sure that you don't overwrite an important file.

5. Alreves comes with some own special routes. Include the following line to your
'routes.rb':

map.from_plugin :alreves

6. In 'app/controllers/application.rb' add action:

  def alreves_init
    @components.push(Component.new())
    render :text => get_response_json
  end

Also comment out 'protect_from_forgery' in the same file.

7. Create a minimal 'public/templates/border.tpl':

<p>Hello World!</p>

8. Run 'script/server' and fire up 'http://localhost:3000/'
