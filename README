-- ALREVES
 
Alreves is an web application framework based on an unusual design
concept. It's still in early development.
 
And the idea behind it?
 
The short answer:
Alreves moves the application view entirely to the client's computer.
 
A bit longer answer:
While usual web application frameworks generate the HTML-code on the
server-side Alreves goes the other way around and processes templates
directly in the user's web browser.
